                Biography
              </h2>
              <p className="font-medium">
                Hi, I'm Emanuela. A year and a half ago I specialized in
                fullstack web development and gained profound knowledge in
                technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, Babel,
                Tailwind, React, React Native, Express, and MongoDB. In my first
                projects, I was able to deepen my skills in the development of
                modern web applications and gain practical experience.
              </p>

              <p className="my-4 font-medium">
                My passion lies in designing user-friendly and appealing user
                interfaces, placing great emphasis on high-quality code. I am
                convinced that a well-designed website or application is crucial
                for the success of services or products.
              </p>

              <p className="font-medium">
                For me, design is more than just beautiful interfaces - it's the
                key to solving problems and creating intuitive, enjoyable user
                experiences. Whether it's a website, mobile app, or other
                digital product, I bring my commitment to design excellence and
                user-centered thinking to every project.
              </p>
